# Prestashop Microsoft Clarity Module

This Prestashop module allows you to easily integrate the Microsoft Clarity tracking tag into your online store.  It helps you understand user behavior on your website through session recordings and heatmaps, providing valuable insights for optimizing your store's performance.

## Features

*   **Simple Integration:** Quickly add the Microsoft Clarity tracking tag to your Prestashop store without directly modifying theme files.
*   **Admin Exclusion:** The tracking tag is automatically excluded for logged-in administrators, ensuring that your own activity isn't tracked.  This prevents skewed data and ensures accurate user behavior analysis.
*   **Configuration:** Easy-to-use configuration form in the Prestashop back office to enter your Microsoft Clarity Project ID.
*   **Prestashop Compatibility:**  Designed to be compatible with Prestashop versions 1.7.6.0, 8.2 and above.

## Installation

1.  **Download:** Download the latest release of the module from the GitHub repository.
2.  **Upload:** Upload the `microsoftclarity` directory to your Prestashop's `modules` directory (e.g., `/modules/microsoftclarity`). You can do this via FTP or using the Prestashop module uploader in the back office.
3.  **Install:** Go to your Prestashop admin panel, navigate to "Modules > Module Manager," and search for "Microsoft Clarity."  Click the "Install" button.
4.  **Configure:** After installing, click the "Configure" button. Enter your Microsoft Clarity Project ID in the form and click "Save."

## Usage

After installing and configuring the module, the Microsoft Clarity tracking tag will be automatically added to every page of your Prestashop store *except* for logged-in administrators.  Start analyzing your user behavior data in your Microsoft Clarity dashboard.

## Configuration

The module's configuration page (accessible after installation in the Modules Manager) allows you to:

*   **Enter Clarity Project ID:**  This is the unique identifier for your project in Microsoft Clarity.  You'll find this ID in your Clarity project settings.

## Requirements

*   Prestashop version 1.7.6.0 or higher.
*   A Microsoft Clarity account. You can create a free account at [https://clarity.microsoft.com/](https://clarity.microsoft.com/).
*   A valid Microsoft Clarity Project ID.
